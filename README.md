## Insights
- Blue Cross insurance had the most number of patients admitted.
- In all the insurance companies more patients above 60(Elderly) where admitted the all other age categories and the paediatric patients where admitted the least.
- There was a rise in patients from 2020 to 2023 with a fall in 2024.
- The most admitted medical condition was Arthritis(8019).
- There was no significant differences in terms of blood group and outcomes for the two different genders.
- The most prescribed medicine was Aspirin.


## Final Conclusion
- To improve and deliver quality care, more resources should be allocated to the Elderly(60+) age group with inventions on prevention and wellness behaviour. There should also be more resources allocated to the care of Arthritis, with emphasis on wellness behaviour and alleviating symptoms.
- Further investigation should be done to ascertain what caused the rise in admissions between 2020 to 2024.
